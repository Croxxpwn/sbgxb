It is also the water source for industries and cities, from Wuxi in Jiangsu to Shanghai, nurturing more than 44 million people.", "As nearby cities flourished during the past three decades, industrial effluent and waste from human activities ravaged the lake. A buildup of nutrients, often caused by fertilizers leaking into the water, resulted in eutrophication, a process that occurs when blue-green algae blooms and strips the oxygen from the water, causing it to stagnate and become putrid, tea-green sludge.", "\"It's a terrible eyesore,\" said Shen Ji, director of the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

But these new technologies are helping us to make great progress, and we hope our experience at Taihu will help other countries to tackle the issue.\"", "Silver carp has long been famous as a classic Chinese dish, but the fish is now also the inspiration for pollution control. Over the course of its life, one silver carp can consume 50 kilograms of algae, but dumping a large number of them into the lake would be expensive and could disturb the delicate ecological balance.", "In response, Li Wenchao, an environmental engineer at the academy, devised a way to emulate the fish's \"feast-and filter\" mechanism and built a bionic platform that removes algae in an efficient, environmentally friendly way.", "The 12-meter-long, 11-meter-wide floating platform loaded with filters is modeled on the gills of the silver carp. It travels across the water at 5 km an hour, gulping the algae in its path and leaving a trail of filtered water in its wake.", "\"It is like a vacuum cleaner for algae,\" Qin said. \"The platform eats the algae, filters and shreds it through 200 layers of 'teeth', and then concentrates it into a thick pulp which is stored on deck. The clean water is then pumped back into the lake.", "Traditionally, floating algae is cleared with large hand-held nets, which is slow, costly and ineffective. The platform can clear algae invisible to the naked eye, and can clean 1 metric ton of water for less than 0.05 yuan. It can be used all day without damaging the environment.", "The prototype was first used in 2011, but by last year, newer, more-compact models had emerged. About 20 lakes and reservoirs now use the platform, ranging from Lake Xingyun in Yunnan province in the south of the country to the Yuqiao reservoir in Tianjin in the north.", "The downside is that the platform costs about 2 million yuan ($290,000) and it is only effective in medium or large lakes, meaning its use is limited to waters that have economic significance, such as tourist attractions and reservoirs, according to Qin. \"Even so, the bionic platform is an effective method of emergency algae control,\" he said."], "title": ["The appliance of science cleans Lake Taihu"]},

He knew that eight subway stations were named after various dismantled gates, but he had no idea why. \n", "\n", "\n", "Beijing, China's capital since the 13th Century, once had 20 city gates. They were built as key passageways for different social classes - including the imperial family, civil and military officials, members of the public and even criminals - to come and go from the city. \n", "During the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, Beijing had nine large city gates. They were mostly pulled down in the 1960s, along with the old city wall, to make way for new roads and subways, and to expand the metropolis. \n", "Records show the gates were more complicated than they appeared. A city gate, topped by a two-story tower, usually comprised a gatehouse, an archers' tower and a barbican. \n", "The city planners only left \"one and a half\" city gates. The \"one gate\" is Zhengyangmen, on Beiijng's north-south axis at the south end of Tiananmen Square. Built in 1419, it is also known as Qianmen, or \"Front Gate\". \n", "Bereft of its side walls and barbicans, Qianmen has been restored with a new face. The \"half gate\" is the Deshengmen archers' tower. \n", "This was news to Li. Born in Shandong province in East China, he arrived in Beijing in 2000 to attend college. Later, he found a job in the capital, married and had a daughter. He knew little about the city's past. \n", "Long working hours meant he seldom played with his daughter. He decided to use the augmented reality technology that he and his colleagues used as a marketing tool for companies such as L'Oreal and Mercedes-Benz to \"build\" a city gate. \n", "His idea resonated with his team of more than 20 developers. Like Li, they mostly hail from other parts of the country, and with an average age of 28, they had little time to study the history of their adopted home city. \n", "In November, Li and his colleagues invited artists to paint pictures of the nine lost gates, based on written materials they discovered online, then posted them in stations. The group invited subway commuters to scan the pictures to get a visual and aural description of the area they were passing through. The visuals were accompanied by a short commentary on the vanished buildings. \n", "When the project was launched in December, passengers loitered in crowded stations and tried the technology. Some enjoyed taking selfies with the virtual models. \n", "In late January and February, a painting was posted at Chaoyangmen subway station on Line Two. \n", "The project can now be seen at the Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall at an exhibition called Technologies Awaken City Memories. \n", "\"It (augmented reality) helps people to learn about the city's history and the changes made,\" Hu Daxin, the hall's deputy curator, said. \"The more you learn, the stronger your sense of belonging.\" \n", "As Beijing has expanded and its population has risen, the subway's tentacles have stretched further and become more complex. Currently, there are 19 lines, covering 574 kilometers. \n", "The demolition of the city gates and walls to build subways and roads has been a controversial topic for decades. \n", "\n", "When the initiative was shared online, it became a public project. \"I was born in Beijing in the 1940s, and I saw the city gates - great world heritage treasures,\" read a post on WeChat. \"They were a great loss. When my child told me about their 'revival', I wanted to see it.\" \n", "However, some people criticized the project because it provided inaccurate information. \n", "The tech engineers received emails and comments saying there were many mistakes: some city walls were painted with angles, when they had actually been arched; the nine gates had encircled the inner city, but the engineers had lined them up; and they had ignored the details on each gate. \n", "In response, Li and his colleagues pointed out that the paintings were works of art, so they could not be 100-percent accurate. The explanation cut no ice with some observers, though, with one commenting: \"Mistakes will mislead the public. You cannot play with history.\" \n", "Li and his colleagues realized how serious the issue was. \"We had a bigger responsibility,\" he said. \n", "The team invited scholars to give talks, and spent days in libraries to study the city's history. They also continued to test their design and decided to use black-and-white photos of the designated spots. \"Photos are real, even though they are not much brighter than the paintings,\" Li said. \n", " \n", "Li's project isn't the first attempt to \"revive\" the city gates. Many Beijingers had already tried to bring them back to life in a variety of ways. \n", "For example, a young photographer made a series of pictures of the gates looming between real buildings and with the busy Second Ring Road below. \n", "He superimposed an old photo of the gates on a picture of the location as it appears today. \n", "Moreover, a retired teacher painted pictures of many razed buildings, including the gates, based on his childhood memories. The paintings have been displayed in museums. \n", "\"I have realized that all citizens share a duty to protect the city's cultural heritage,\" Li said. \n", "His daughter has benefited too.
